# DESCRIPTION OF TASK
The File Handling Utility in Java is a comprehensive program designed to perform fundamental file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. Built using Java, it employs essential tools like the Java Development Kit (JDK) and IntelliJ IDEA IDE for development and execution. The utility leverages Java's I/O package, specifically classes like BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and FileWriter, which are core to efficient file handling. Additionally, the program uses the Scanner class from java.util for capturing user input. Resources such as Java documentation and file handling tutorials guided the development process, ensuring adherence to best practices. The program follows a modular design, with methods dedicated to specific tasks: reading a file line by line, overwriting file content, and appending new data while ensuring files are created automatically if they do not exist. Upon execution, the utility displays a menu-driven interface in the console, allowing users to select operations interactively. Outputs such as file content, success messages, and error alerts (e.g., for missing files or invalid inputs) are displayed in real-time, providing a clear and functional demonstration of file I/O operations. This tool highlights practical applications of file handling and serves as a valuable resource for learning and development.
